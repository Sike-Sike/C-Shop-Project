# C++-Shop-Project
This is a school project built using c++. I just uploaded it to github to show that "Yes, I do know C++ somewhat akshually!"

For this project, the following actions can be performed for inventory management of a shop.

1. Add item
2. Remove item
3. Buy item
4. Return item
5. Rename item
6. Update price
7. Add inventory
8. Item details
9. Display revenue
10. Exit

To run the project, clone the project and ``cd`` into the project directory. Then run:
```
g++ -o shop shop.cpp
```
For this to work g++ must be installed.

Then run the binary by:
```
./shop
```
